It is a national academy and the highest research institution in Greece presently.</em></p>

            <p><em>Spinalonga Island is one of Greece's most intriguing historical landmarks and a must-visit when travelling to Crete.<br><br>
            Its history goes back to the 16th century when the island was fortified during the Venetian rule in Crete. Later on, it was also a refuge for the Christians and Ottomans, but today, it's mostly known as one of the last active leper colonies in Europe.</em></p>

            <li><strong>Sanctuary of Delphi</strong></li>
